# NeuralScope_YOLOvX
This is a web application built with Streamlit that allows users to perform real-time object detection using YOLO models. The app supports various input sources such as webcam, uploaded video and image files, HTTP URLs, and RTSP URLs. By default, the app uses YOLOv7 for object detection, and includes a custom gun detection model suitable for public safety and law enforcement applications.

To use the app, you can clone this repository and install the dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. Then, run the app using streamlit run app.py. The user interface is easy to navigate and includes adjustable settings for a more personalized experience. You can also upload your own .pt weight files to customize the YOLO model for your specific use case.

Contributions to the project are welcome. If you encounter any issues or have any suggestions, please create an issue in the GitHub repository.
